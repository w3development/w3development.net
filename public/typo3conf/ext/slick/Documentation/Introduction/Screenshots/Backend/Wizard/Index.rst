	New Content Element Wizard with Slick

Slick provides four content elements:

* the slick slider with content elements (from TYPO3 8.7)

* the slick slider with file collections (from TYPO3 8.7)

* the slick slider with images (from TYPO3 8.7)

* and the slick slider item

You can use other slick slider content elements from former TYPO3 versions, 
but they aren't needed any longer and they are marked as deprecated.

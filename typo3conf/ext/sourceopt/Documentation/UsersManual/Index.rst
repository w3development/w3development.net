Users manual
------------

This extension simply clears a little bit the final output of a page
by using various optimization-methods. The possibilities you'll find
under the reference in this user manual.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the extension and go (for example) to the Constant Editor of a
template where you find all the possible options under
“PLUGIN.SOURCEOPT” (see also reference below). Nothing else to do.

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: The EXT:sourceopt process need server performance, because there are several search replace operations
in the PHP logic of the extension. Please take care of this and monitor your server.
